<h1>ReversePicture</h1>
<p>
That little programm reverse the colors of an image-copy. </br>
Necessary for the Programm is only the ReversePicture-directory</br>
The programm gets started by clicking the run.bat (ReversePicture/run.bat).</br>
At least one picture has to be in the input-folder (ReversePicture/wwwroot/input),</br>
if there is no picture, it will happen nothing obvious.<</br>
If it worked properly, in the output-folder (ReversePicture/wwwroot/output) should be some reversed pictures.</br>
</p>
</br>
<p>
In the src-folder are the java-files, if someone want to use them by themself.
