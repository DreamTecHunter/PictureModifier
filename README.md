<h1>ReversePicture</h1>
<p>
That little programm reverse the colors of an image-copy. 
The programm gets started by clicking the run.bat (ReversePicture/run.bat).
At least one picture has to be in the input-folder (ReversePicture/input),
if there is no picture, it will happen nothing obvious.
If it worked properly, in the output-folder (ReversePicture/output) should be some reversed pictures.

In the src-folder are the java-files, if someone want to use them by themself.
